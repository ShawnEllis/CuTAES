CuTAES COMP2404 Project
=======================

------------------------

CuTAES uses ncurses with the form and panel libraries. To run, make it then either do ./bin/cuTAES.out or go into bin and do ./cuTAES.out. I've put the data folders in both places so it will always find it. Depending on where you run it from, it will save in different folders; if the course list is empty, the data folder wasn't found.

If the View an Application feature looks messed up, you need to resize your terminal. You will need to do some action (hit up key / enter etc) to refresh the screen. I suggest starting the program with the terminal fullscreened to avoid any issues.

testCases.cpp is not in src, make with it for testing.
