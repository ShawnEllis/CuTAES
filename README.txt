CuTAES COMP2404 Project
=======================

------------------------

CuTAES uses ncurses with the form and panel libraries. To run, make it then either do ./bin/cuTAES.out or go into bin and do ./cuTAES.out. I've put the data folders in both places so it will always find it. Depending on where you run it from, it will save in different folders.
I could not get sorting to work properly before the deadline, so it does not sort applications by GPA yet. You can still view them. Validation is also minimal at this point; the general information form does some validation, but it's not strict enough.

If the View an Application feature looks messed up, you need to resize your terminal. You will need to do some action (hit up key / enter etc) to refresh the screen. I suggest starting the program with the terminal fullscreened.

Be sure to read UML.pdf and DesignDoc.pdf.
